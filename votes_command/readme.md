# Microservices Architecture - Votes Service

## Overview

This microservices architecture is designed to handle products, reviews, and votes for a product review system. The system is composed of three main microservices:

1. **Products Microservice:** Manages the creation and retrieval of products.
2. **Reviews Microservice:** Handles the creation and retrieval of reviews, and subscribes to product creation events.
3. **Votes Microservice:** Manages the voting system for reviews.

## Problem

The challenge arises in deciding whether the Votes microservice should include information about both products and reviews or if it should focus solely on reviews.

## Considerations

### Including Products in Votes Service

**Pros:**
- Simplifies querying and reporting for votes related to specific products.
- Avoids the need for cross-service queries to retrieve product information while processing votes.

**Cons:**
- Increases the coupling between the Votes service and the Products service.
- May lead to redundancy if products are already maintained in the Products service.

### Including Only Reviews in Votes Service

**Pros:**
- Simplifies the design and reduces the scope of the Votes service to focus solely on the voting mechanism for reviews.
- Decouples the Votes service from changes in the Products service.

**Cons:**
- Requires cross-service queries to retrieve product information when needed for reporting or other functionalities.

## Decision

After careful consideration, we have decided to include only reviews in the Votes service. This decision aligns with microservices best practices, promoting loose coupling between services and allowing each service to focus on its core responsibilities.

## Implementation Details

- The Votes service will manage votes exclusively for reviews.
- Cross-service communication mechanisms will be implemented to retrieve product information when necessary.

## Future Considerations

As the system evolves, we will continuously evaluate the impact of this decision on performance, scalability, and overall system efficiency. Adjustments may be made based on evolving requirements and system dynamics.
